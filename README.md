# FairKM
Code for Fairness in Clustering with Multiple Sensitive Attributes
'baseline_imtiaz.py' is the code for the [baseline paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Clustering-with-Fairness-Constraints%3A-A-Flexible-Ziko-Granger/d56841fe68f2a913583a40edf541efeaed0a7e5b). 
'fairK-Means.py' experiments with naive K-Means, S-blind clustering, proposed FairKM and baseline method on the dataset attached. 
The code also shows how FairKM is invoked in two cases - the first where multiple attributes (5 attributes) are considered as sensitive attributes simultaneously and the second where a single sensitive attribute (eg. gender) is considered.
